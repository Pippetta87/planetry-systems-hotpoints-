\chapter{Chemical-physical Characteristic: composition, chronology, ...}

\section{CAI, condrules formation and dating}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \cite{bollard2017early}. 
    \item \cite{yin2002short}.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\cel{Hf}{182}\to\cel{W}{182}$ (\SI{9}{\mega\year})
        \item Identical $\frac{\cel{W}{182}}{\cel{W}{183}}$ in chondritic silicate and bulk silicate of Earth: core segration \SI{60}{\mega\year} after beginning of solar system (when $\cel{Hf}{182}$) was extinct
        \item He/Ne of Earth mantles requires most of planetary accretion occurred before solar nebula dissipated
        \item \cite{morbidelli2016fossilized}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Water depletion of inner solar system is puzzling
            \item Appearence of icy particles in regions swept by iceline can only be due to radial drift
            \item Planetary systems without giant planet should be water richer in inner regions than our
            \item Inner edge of planetesimal disk at \SI{0.7}{\astronomicalunit} (small mass of Mercury) cloud be due to silicate condensation line fossilized at end of streamline instability that generated planetesimal seeds
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

\chapter{Statistical properties of planetary population}

\section{Giant planets}

\cite{santerne2018populations}
\begin{itemize}
    \item 
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Caratteristiche popolazione pianeti giganti}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \cite{dawson2013giant}.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Giant with $a<1$ orbiting metal rich star have range of $e$, those orbiting metal poor stars are restricted to lower e
        \item Metal rich stars have most eccentric proto-hot Jupiter undergoing tidal circularization
        \item Pile-up of short period giant planet missing in kepler is recovered considering metal rich stars
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Radial velocity surveys}

\chapter{Sub-saturn planets $4-8\rearth{}$}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \cite{petigura2017four}.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Most massive sub-saturn lack detected companion and have eccentric orbit
        \item Weak correlation between $f_{env}$ e $T_{eq}$
        \item $f_{env}(M_P,S_{inc},t_{age})$
        \item Stellar Metallicity and planet metallicity: more metal rich disk harm more massive planet core growing smoothly in more masive planets; disks with more solid form more massive cores perturbing neighbouring plantes and leading to collisions merger (Anticorrelation between $M_P$ and $Z_p/Z_*$ - Thorngren16: dispersion below T. relation for $M_P/M_*<\num{e-4}$) - transition in formation path for $M_P\leq30\mearth$
        \item Eccentricity and planet molteplicity: Uncertainties in eccentricity damping time-scale ($Q'$ factor)
        \item For sub-saturn $\frac{v_{esc}}{v_{orb}}\approx\numrange{0.1}{0.3}$
        \item Observational bias and planet multiplicity
    \end{itemize}
