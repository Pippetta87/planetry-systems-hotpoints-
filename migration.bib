Integrable Hamiltonian formalism for first order planetary resonances. Resonant capture: adiabatic regime/resonance locking criterion. Evolution of Jupiter-Saturn within solar nebula and dominantly non resonant sub-jovian exoplanets: hypothesis is that exopair encounters resonance in slightly $e=\num{0.02}$ orbits; low mass planet resonance-capture is inefficient due to axial asymmetries of PPD}
